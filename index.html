                    environment and affects everyone: humans, animals, crops, cities, forests, and aquatic ecosystems.

                    littering, corporate irresponsibility, lack of governance, but it all boils down to a single point.
                    It is not natural. Pollution is the consequence of humanity’s carelessness and its impact to society
                    is far more grave than we realize. In the eyes of the privileged, it may seem like pollution is a
                    shallow topic to swallow, considering how saturated it is already. However, for the poor, pollution
                    may just be the cause of their death. There is nothing natural about pollution. As most wastes found
                    in polluted sites cannot degrade naturally. These are the plastics, electronic components, wet
                    wipes, rubber-nearly all common everyday items are the cause of pollution.</p>

                <p class="issuestext2">Green capitalism is a coined term used to describe the actions of corporations
                    taking advantage of advocacies for profit. Issues surrounding the environment have always been
                    treated as something shallow as compared to its contemporaries. This is due to people jumping on
                    shallow acts of activism to either acquire clout or simply present themselves as socially aware of
                    such issues. Companies have been doing this tactic since the 90’s and people still have not learned
                    to channel their care toward something more productive. The bottom line is that
                    corporations do not care and even if they do, the gross actions they do still outweigh the few
                    months of pandering they do for advocacy groups.</p>

                    the air around his kingdom. This was the start of Britian's air problem.</p>

                    <h5 class="solutionT">Air Monitoring</h5>
                    <p class="soltext2">Nearly all countries have some form of air-monitoring system. It is basically
                        the
                        process of checking the air quality index of each geographical area to determine if it is safe
                        and use this information to try to alleviate said issues. What science-oriented air monitoring
                        means is that it is the systematic, long-term assessment of pollutant levels by measuring the
                        quantity and types of certain pollutants in the surrounding, outdoor air with the next step in
                        mind. Meaning, the data the monitoring system mines will be logged in the database of its
                        respective local and the data will be used in identifying patterns and threats with the air we
                        breathe currently.</p>

                    <p class="soltext">Biofuels of plant origin proved to be controversial due to competition for food
                        production, fertile land and expensive production processes. As a secondary alternative,
                        microalgae such as Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis sp. were found
                        to be suitable candidates for liquid biofuels production. This is a brief description of their
                        proposal to combat climate change. An accessible alternative to competitive biomass.</p>

                    <p class="soltext2">Changing the raw materials that capitalism uses for production to make sure it
                        is
                        environmentally sustainable. This is supported by Rocha, de Souza, & Prentice (2018) as their
                        study on alternative packaging cut down costs while removing the strain on natural resources.
                        Mazur (2018) also shares the sentiment of changing green capitalism by proposing to change the
                        transport system of products, since emission is a unsustainable issue made by deliveries,
                        transfers, and transport-related activities needing vehicles, the use of electric cars cut down
                        those harmful emissions and can radically increase air quality and increase efficiency.</p>

                    <p class="soltext">The proposition of a total change in green capitalism lies in changing the
                        process it is built upon. Technological and organizational fixes, such as cutting energy costs,
                        improving packaging materials, minimizing transport distances, and building green brands
                        credentials are some of the facets that drive green capitalism toward the capitalistic side
                        rather than the green side. </p>

                    future solutions need to keep in mind that science should always be inclusive. It must always answer
                    yes to the question of accessibility, scalability, and comprehensiveness.</p>

                <p class="r2">the focus of these solutions should be proposing solutions that target corporations and
                    not the average person in the first place. If the responsibility of solving climate change falls
                    under the average people then the corporations who abuse the environment will only take advantage of
